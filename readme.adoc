= The TrumpWorld Graph

image::https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-01/13/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-31493-1484333437-1.jpg?no-auto[float=right,width=300]

It all started with Jeremy Singer-Vine and his co-authors publishing a partial dataset of connections between organizations and people around Donald Trump.

The data was made available as a public Google Document, which we imported into Neo4j so that it became queryable and visualizable.

You can access the TrumpWorld Graph live at http://bit.ly/trumpworld (username/pwd - trumpworld/trumpworld)

You can also run the TrumpWorld Guide in any Neo4j Browser by executing `:play http://guides.neo4j.com/trumpworld`

Which cover the import, queries and visualizations and the extension with the federal contract data.

In this repository you can find the different resources and scripts for imports, querying and visualization.
