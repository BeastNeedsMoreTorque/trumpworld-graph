= The TrumpWorld Graph

image::https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-01/13/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/sub-buzz-31493-1484333437-1.jpg?no-auto[float=right,width=300]

It all started with Jeremy Singer-Vine and his co-authors publishing a partial dataset of connections between organizations and people around Donald Trump.

The data was made available as a public Google Document, which we imported into Neo4j so that it became queryable and visualizable.

You can access the TrumpWorld Graph live at https://neo4j.com/sandbox

You can also run the TrumpWorld Guide in any Neo4j Browser by executing `:play http://guides.neo4j.com/trumpworld`

Which cover the import, queries and visualizations and the extension with the federal contract data.

In this repository you can find the different resources and scripts for imports, querying and visualization.

The Times reports that one of the advisers is Paul Manafort, who was Trump’s campaign chairman for several months last year and previously worked as a consultant in Ukraine for a politician backed by the Kremlin
> The F.B.I. has closely examined at least three other people close to Mr. Trump, although it is unclear if their calls were intercepted. They are Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign; Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative; and Mr. Flynn.”

[02:14]  
>>>Senior Obama administration officials said they felt so uncertain about the nature of the Flynn-Kislyak relationship that they took it upon themselves to scale back what they told Flynn and others on his incoming national security team, particularly on sensitive matters related to Russia. … ‘We did decide to not share with them certain things about Russia,’ a former senior Obama administration official said. ‘We just thought, who knew? Would that information be safe?’ … Susan E. Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, did not give Flynn advance notice of the sanctions that the White House planned to impose on Russia over its meddling in the election. Instead, Denis McDonough, who at the time was Obama’s chief of staff, waited until the sanctions were announced to inform his Trump counterpart…”
